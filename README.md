Our Challenge (ZOO)
	The earth is home to countless species and we all should envision a world where wildlife and humans flourish together. 
	Our ZOOs dedicate themselves to save wildlife and their habitats through conservation, research, education, and engaging experiences. 
	In all of this, ZOOs are a complex institutions involving lots of processes, data, and human resources. 
	Propose a solution that might help ZOOs to connect people to animals and inspire conservation action to save endangered species. 
	Feel free to use the generally available APIs and data delivered by Łódź ZOO.
